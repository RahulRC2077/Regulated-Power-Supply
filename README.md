## Theoretical Background

The regulated power supply is an embedded circuit. Converts unstabilized alternating current (alternating current) to constant direct current. With the help of a rectifier, it converts alternating current to direct current. Its function is to provide a stable voltage (or rarely current) to circuits or devices that need to operate within certain power limits. It provides constant voltage irrespective of the variations in input voltage.
